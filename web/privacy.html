  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 15, 2026</p>

  <p>AI Math Test ("the App") is a free educational tool that generates personalized math practice for children in grades K–12. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how you can manage it.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you sign in with Google, we receive:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google account info</strong> — display name, email address, and profile photo URL</li>
    <li><strong>Child profiles</strong> — name, grade level, and avatar (entered by the parent)</li>
    <li><strong>Test &amp; score data</strong> — generated questions, answers, scores, and timestamps</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect location data, device identifiers, or any data beyond what is listed above.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticate your account via Google Sign-In</li>
    <li>Generate age-appropriate math questions using AI</li>
    <li>Track progress and display score history</li>
    <li>Personalize difficulty based on past performance</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
  <p>All data is stored in <strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Firestore database) within Google Cloud infrastructure. Data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest. Access is restricted to authenticated users viewing only their own data.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal data with any third parties. The only external service that processes data is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Gemini API</strong> — receives grade level, topic, and difficulty to generate math questions. No personal information (names, emails) is sent to the AI.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Children's Privacy (COPPA)</h2>
  <p>The App is designed for use by <strong>parents/guardians</strong> on behalf of their children:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Only a parent or guardian can create an account (Google Sign-In)</li>
    <li>Child profiles are created and managed entirely by the parent</li>
    <li>Children do not directly provide any personal information</li>
    <li>We do not knowingly collect data directly from children under 13</li>
    <li>Parents can view, edit, or delete all child data at any time</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Test results</strong> are retained for 90 days, then automatically deleted</li>
    <li><strong>Profiles and account data</strong> are retained until you delete them</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can delete your data at any time:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Delete a child profile</strong> — go to Settings → edit the profile → Delete. This removes the profile and all associated test history.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete your account</strong> — sign out and contact us to request full account deletion. All data will be permanently removed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or your data, contact us at:</p>
